# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the central hub for OctoAcme's project management documentation. This README serves as your starting point to understand our methodology and navigate our process documentation.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a **customer-centered, iterative, and data-informed** approach to project management. Our methodology is built around:

- **Clear Roles**: Well-defined responsibilities for Product Manager, Project Manager, Developer, and Stakeholder
- **Comprehensive Project Phases**: Documentation covering Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Continuous Improvement
- **Core Principles**: Clarity, ownership, risk management, and transparent communication

## Project Lifecycle

Our project lifecycle guides teams from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement:

1. **Initiation**: Define the problem statement, identify stakeholders, establish success criteria, and create the Project One-pager to secure approval for planning.

2. **Planning**: Transform approved initiatives into actionable plans. Break work into shippable increments, create a prioritized backlog, estimate scope, and define release milestones.

3. **Execution & Tracking**: Manage day-to-day delivery through daily standups, sprint demos, and continuous integration. Track progress, velocity, and success metrics while addressing blockers.

4. **Risk & Communication**: Proactively identify, assess, and mitigate risks using a Risk Register. Maintain transparent communication with stakeholders through regular updates and clear escalation paths.

5. **Release & Deployment**: Follow standardized release procedures to deploy features safely. Ensure pre-release requirements are met, execute deployment checklists, and have rollback plans ready.

6. **Retrospectives & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings after each sprint, release, or milestone. Convert insights into actionable improvements and track their impact.
